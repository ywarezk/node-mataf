## Express introduction - our first backend application.

our backend apps will run on a server
our apps will listen for request and return response
client ---> server - backend app
protocol http
http the server is passive
server returns data -> html, json, js, css, img
server -> johnbryce.com/about/hello
http is stateless

## How will we build our backend app

- we are going to get help from a framework called express.

express will help us solve common problems
with express we can use tons of community libraries.

## What is express.js

express.js if framework runs on Node.js
will help us build apps that will get http request and return http response
